External-Config
===============
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sbglasius/external-config.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sbglasius/external-config)

This plugin will mimic the Grails 2 way of handling external configurations defined in `grails.config.locations`.

VERSIONS!
---------
The `grails-3.x` branch is for Grails 3.x, `master` will, moving forward be for Grails 4.x

IMPORTANT!
----------
The External Config Plugin (1.1.0 and above) no longer needs to implement `ExternalConfig` on `Application.groovy`. It now uses a `SpringApplicationRunListener`and hooks into the startup automagically. So if you used the plugin in prior versions, please remove `implements ExternalConfig` from `Application.groovy`

Installation
------------

Add dependency to your `build.gradle`:

```
dependencies {
    compile 'org.grails.plugins:external-config:1.2.2'
}
```

To use a snapshot-version

add JFrog OSS Repository to the `repositories`:
```
repositories {
    maven { url "https://oss.jfrog.org/repo/" }
}
```

and specify the snapshot version as a dependency:
```
dependencies {
    compile 'org.grails.plugins:external-config:1.3.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

Usage
-----

When you add this plugin to your Grails build, it will automatically look for the property `grails.config.locations`. Define this in in either `application.yml` like this:

```
grails:
    config:
        locations:
            - classpath:myconfig.groovy
            - classpath:myconfig.yml
            - classpath:myconfig.properties
            - file:///etc/app/myconfig.groovy
            - file:///etc/app/myconfig.yml
            - file:///etc/app/myconfig.properties
            - ~/.grails/myconfig.groovy
            - ~/.grails/myconfig.yml
            - ~/.grails/myconfig.properties
            - file:${catalina.base}/myconfig.groovy
            - file:${catalina.base}/myconfig.yml
            - file:${catalina.base}/myconfig.properties
```

or in `application.groovy` like this:

```
grails.config.locations = [
        "classpath:myconfig.groovy",
        "classpath:myconfig.yml",
        "classpath:myconfig.properties",
        "file:///etc/app/myconfig.groovy",
        "file:///etc/app/myconfig.yml",
        "file:///etc/app/myconfig.properties",
        "~/.grails/myconfig.groovy",
        "~/.grails/myconfig.yml",
        "~/.grails/myconfig.properties",
        'file:${catalina.base}/myconfig.groovy',
        'file:${catalina.base}/myconfig.yml',
        'file:${catalina.base}/myconfig.properties',
]
```

It is also possible to define it in an environment specific block (groovy):
```$xslt
environments {
    test {
        grails {
            config {
                locations = [...]
            }
        }
    }
}   
```

or (yml)

```
environments:
    test:
        grails:
            config:
                locations:
                - ... 
```

`~/` references the users `$HOME` directory.
Notice, that using a system property you should use single quotes because otherwise it's interpreted as a Gstring.

The plugin will skip configuration files that are not found. 

For `.groovy` and `.yml` files the `environments` blocks in the config file are interpreted the same way, as in `application.yml` or `application.groovy`.

**Wildcard support**

It is possible to use `*` as wildcards in the filename part of the configuration:

```
grails:
    config:
        locations:
            - file:/etc/app/myconfig*.groovy
            - ~/.grails/myconfig*.groovy
```
or
```
grails.config.locations = [
        "file:/etc/app/myconfig*.groovy",
        "~/.grails/myconfig*.groovy",
]
```
__Note__: that it only works for the `file:` and `~/` prefix. 

__Note__: the wildcards are in the order they are found in the `locations` list, but the order of the expanded `locations` for each wildcard is not guaranteed, and is dependent on the OS used.

**Getting configuration from another folder than /conf on classpath without moving it with Gradle script**

If you wish to make your Grails application pull external configuration from classpath when running locally, but you do not wish to get it packed into the assembled war file (i.e. place the external configuration file in e.g. /external-config instead of /conf), then you can include the external configuration file to the classpath by adding the following line to build.gradle:dependencies
```
providedCompile files('external-config') // providedCompile to ensure that external config is not included in the war file
```
Alternatively, you can make a gradle script to move the external configuration file to your classpath (e.g. /build/classes)

Scripts
-----
This plugin also includes two scripts, one for converting yml config, to groovy config,
and one for converting groovy config to yml config. These scripts are not guaranteed to be 
perfect, but you should report any edge cases for the yml to groovy config here:
https://github.com/virtualdogbert/GroovyConfigWriter/issues

grails yml-to-groovy-config has the following parameters:
* ymlFile - The yml input file.
* asClosure - An optional flag to set the output to be closure based or map based. The Default is closure based 
* outputFile - The optional output file. If none is provided, then the output will go to System.out.
* indent - Optional indent. The default is 4 spaces
* escapeList - An optional CSV list of values to escape, with no spaces. The default is 'default'


Sample usage:
```
grails yml-to-groovy-config [ymlFile] [optional asClosure] [optional outputFile] [optional indent] [optional escape list]
```

grails groovy-to-yml-config has the following parameters:
* groovy - The groovy input file.'
* outputFile - The optional output file. If none is provided, then the output will go to System.out.
* indent' - Sets the optional indent level for a file. The default is 4
* flow - Sets the optional style of BLOCK or FLOWS. The default is BLOCK.

sample usage:
```
grails groovy-to-yml-config [ymlFile] [optional outputFile] [optional indent] [optinal flow]
```
